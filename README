Process:
-> Requirements to be broken down into user stories in the following format:
*As a* [type of user],
*I want to* [describe what needs to be achieved]
*So I can* [describe end goal of the task]

-> Acceptance Criteria to be defined for each user story that will be a prerequisite for marking the user story as 'Completed/Closed'.

->Each user story to be assigned to one or more team members for development.

-> Each user story to be developed as a separate branch from the master branch.

->A different team member(s) to be assigned for reviewing the code for each user story.

-> Post successful peer review and meeting of acceptance criteria a pull request to be raised.

-> Merging of the branch to the master branch
